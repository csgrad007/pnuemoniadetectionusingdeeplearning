The complete processes of the proposed model for Pneumonia infection identification are described further indetail. 
The entire method is separated into a number of stages in the following subsections, starting with collecting the images for the classification process
We got training accuracy as 97.21 % with train loss as 0.4010 and training mean iou as 0.7192
We got validation accuracy as 97.30 % with validation loss as 0.4241 and validation mean iou as 0.7294
